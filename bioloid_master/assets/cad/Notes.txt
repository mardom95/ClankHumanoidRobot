Bioloid CAD models were originally downloaded from Robotis: http://www.robotis.com/xe/download_en/26324
Utilised CAD programs and operations are written in shorthand in the file name suffixes.
- FCD-Conv: .stp files were converted to .dae (Collada) using FreeCAD
- BDR-Col: .dae files were coloured in Blender

The originally converted .dae model units are in mm. Saving again as .dae in Blender shrunk the model by 100.
To fix this, the files were edited by commenting out the scaling from all nodes under the <library_visual_scenes> element:
<matrix sid="transform">0.01 0 0 0 0 0.01 0 0 0 0 0.01 0 0 0 0 1</matrix>

There is also a bug in RViz which replaces the ambient color of Collada materials by light gray if at
least one component of the specified ambient color is 0.0.
To fix this, the files were edited by replacing:
<color sid="ambient">0 0 0 1</color>
with:
<color sid="ambient">0.1 0.1 0.1 1</color>
